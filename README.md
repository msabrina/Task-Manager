## Interview Sample Application

Full stack application which performs CRUD operations on a simplistic data model.


## Discussion 
This application was built usign a microservice architecture approach where the user interface is separated from the business logic.

One of my main goals was to delivered the app via containerization. I started off by Dockerizing the app during early build stages. Docker is a tool I haven't worked with before so I was excited to learn it and try to implemented.

## Chanllenges
I encountered a lot of bugs running docker-compose and mongodb. 


## Take-aways

Starting off small and scaling up the technologies as the app build progressed.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
### `docker-compose up`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Technologies 
### Node.js v10.15.3
### Express v4.16.0 
### React v16.8.4
### React Redux v6.0.1
### Mongodb v3.2.1
### Docker v18.09.2

## Technical Considerations 
Application uses in-memory storage to store tasks


## Bonuses
